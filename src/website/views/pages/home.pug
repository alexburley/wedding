      | !{' '} Welcome to our wedding website! We're so excited to tell you a bit more about ourselves and the big day.
      | !{' '} We got engaged on 28th December 2020 and some might argue this event has been a long time coming,
      | !{' '} the wedding being 10 years since our first date at Starbucks, Durham...
    p It was overcast, Alex ordering an Americano,
      | !{' '} Becky unfortunately ordering an orange juice. The day had a rough start, with a nervous Alex
      | !{' '} succumbing to a local merchant on Elvet Bridge and tragically turning up to the date with a Â£2 jokebook.
      | !{' '} Humoured, energized and full of Vitamin C we wandered into Durham to finish our date
      | !{' '} and eagerly arrange the next few dates, which primarily consisted of watching the Chase and eating chicken goujons.
      | !{' '} Commentators have described this early courtship as:
      i !{' '} written in the stars.

        style="width: 55%; min-width: 200px"
      )
    p Ten years later and third time lucky, we're delighted to invite you all to our big day.
      | !{' '}When looking for venues we picked Healey Barn for the amazing setting and to be close to our family homes in
      | !{' '}Durham and Chester Le Street, even if it is a long way from where we currently live in Wapping, London.
      | !{' '}That being said, one of the most important factors was the 1AM late license...
    p For many of you this will be the first time meeting one of the two of us and we can't wait to bring both of our families
      | !{' '} together on the special day. We hope to see lots of friends and family from both sides and for our southern
      | !{' '} based attendees: we wish you all the best being in a room full of northerners.
